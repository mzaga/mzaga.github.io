 I was only 10 years old in this picture when me and my family travelled to Paris,France. I love this picture because Paris is a really great city full of culture and good people. My favorite thing about the city is its cuisine. I remember when I went, my dad would go to a local shop and get a fresh baguette and a different cheese everyday for breakfast. I really miss that aspect of the city. My favorite place in the city was the Champs-Élysées avenue, which led to the Arc De Triomphe. This was a truly beautiful site to visit and I will forever remember it.

  I went to Rio De Janeiro a little over 2 years ago. This was an amazing experience as It was my first time visiting South America. To start with, the people are extremely friendly and helpful. When we were lost, many people came to us to help us find our ways through the city. My favorite experience of Rio was walking into an all you can eat steak on swords restaurants. Not only was the actual food amazing, but the service was spectacular. THey made us feel right at home. I will forever remember this city.

 How do I start with Costa Rica? This was by far one of my favorite trips of all my life. It wasn't necessarily the actual place that made the trip so great, even though it was, but the people there with me made it amazing. I travelled with The Ken, having all of my friends with me by my side the whole trip. We went zip lining, river rafting, and more amazing activities. The only thing that was not amazing about the trip was the food. All that people eat in Costa Rica is rice and beans, without exaggeration.
