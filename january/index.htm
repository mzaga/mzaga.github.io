   My brother came back to San Diego after spending the first semester of this school year in Les Roches University in Switzerland. I missed him very much and had a great time with him <br clear="left"></p>

    All four of us where together for the first time in a long time, so we sent a lot of time together. It was really nice to go back to the old das for the short time it was. In this picture, we are at Monte Xanic winery.
