  Hong Kong is definitley one of my favorite places that I have ever traveled to in my whole life. Even though it is not the most coltural or prettiest place I have been to, it was an extemeley remarkable experience going there for me. Not only is this city insanley modern and equipped with amazing and inovative techinology, but it is packed with nonstop energy fowing through the streats of the city 24/7. The food is amazing, having influence from the whole world. During my 3 day stay, I ate food over 6 different countries, all delicious.

  As I have already included, Rio De Janiero is by far one of my favorite cities in the world. It is challenging to find one flaw about it. The place itslef is absolutley beutiful, the beaches were outsanding along with the sunny weather. The food thewre is  what drove me crazy the mosg. All the different steaks I ate were very tasty, making me wish I could travel there more often. Brazil is known for it's soccer supporters, so it was very nice for me to be able to talk about with the few poeple that spoke Spainsh, with them being as passionate as they are about the sport.

  Prague is an amazing city, beutiful and packed with colture. I visited with my family over 4 years ago and will truly be a place that I never forget. It is the most unique place I have ever been to. I felt like I was in Hollywood as I walked up the streets. I remeber going to many old castles which were absolutley unforegettable. Even though it is very qujite and calm, I highly recommend visiting this city.
