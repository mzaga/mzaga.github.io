  Hong Kong is definitley one of my favorite places that I have ever traveled to in my whole life. Ecen though it is not eh most coltural or beutifuk place I have ben to, it was an extemeley remarkable experience going there for me. Not only is it insanley modern and equipped with amazing and inovative tehcinology, but it is packed with nonstop energy fowing through the streats of the city 24/7. The food is amazing, having influence from the whole world. During my 3 day stay, I ate food from more than 6 different countries, all amazing.

  As I have already included, Rio De Janiero is by far one of my favorite cities in the world. It is challenging to find one flaw about it. The place itslef isabsolutley beutiful, the beaches were outsanding and the sunny weathjer as well. The food thewre is mainlywhat drove me crazy. All the different steaks I ate were extremely tasty, making me wish I could travel there more oftenly. Brazil being packed with soccer supporters, it was very nice for me to tlak with the few poeple that spoke Spainsh about it, as they are extrmeley passionate about the sport.

  Prague is an amazing city, beutiful and packed with Colture. I visited with my family over 4 years ago and will truly be a place thaty I never forget. It the most unique place I have ever been to. I felt like I was in Hollywood as I walked up the streets. I remeber going to many old castles which were absolutley insane. I highly recommend visiting this city.
