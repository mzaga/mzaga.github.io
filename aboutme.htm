 On Novemeber 28th, 2003, I was born in Mexico City, Mexico. Even though I moved here when I was only 2 years old, I consider myself mexican at hart and love my country greatly. To this day I speak fluent Spanish and speak it all the time with both my friends and parents. I hope I never forget this languasge as I believe it is a huge part of who I am. My favoreite mexican food is by far chilaquiles, a mixture of crispy tortillas and either salsa verde, or salsa roja. I've ate this for my whole life and will never stop. Viva Mexico!

  Moving into 6th grade I decided to move to the San Diego Jewidh Academy and have been attenging ever since and im currently finishing my 5th year. I am extremely happy being with all my friends that I have known since I was 3 years old. Not only do I love the friends side of it, but I love the school campus itslef. It's huge and doesnt make you feel trapped like at my old school. Not only is it modern, but it also provides us with great athletic privelages. Not only do we have 6 tennis courts but an extrmeley nice soccer/football field and 2 baseball fields.

  My whole life I have been extremely into sports. Ever since I could remeber I was playing soccer on  Manchester United of Carmel Valley. Not only is soccer in my blood, but it plays a huge part of my life. I have always followed my 2 favorite teams, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Even though soccer is my favorite spot, it is not the only one I follow. Football and Basketball are also 2 sports which I deeply enjoy to both watch and play. With the New England Patriots being my favorite team, I could say it is quite enjoyable for me during the NFL season.
